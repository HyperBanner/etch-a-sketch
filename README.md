# Once again, WOW
This was HARD. Figuring out all the little details of this took quite a while. This was a noticeable step up from the previous projects, but I still think I somehow ended up coding this better than the previous projects.
There's still probably some "unclean" code, or I may have not done the best, most effective implementation ever, that wasn't my goal either. I'm still a beginner, so I'm just glad I managed to complete this (Without using AI either!).

Thank you [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com/) for assigning me this project.
